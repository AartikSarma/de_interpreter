# Optional dependencies for literature scoring functionality
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-scoring.txt

# Core scoring dependencies
sentence-transformers>=2.0.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.20.0

# For CUDA support (optional, for faster BioBERT processing)
# torch>=1.9.0

# Alternative BioBERT models (will be downloaded automatically when used)
# These don't need to be installed via pip - they're model weights downloaded by sentence-transformers

# Recommended models:
# - sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (fast baseline)
# - microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract (biomedical)
# - dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1 (BioBERT original)
